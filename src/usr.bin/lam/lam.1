.Sh NAME
.Nm lam
.Nd laminate files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl F\*(Baf Ar min.max
.Op Fl P\*(Bap Ar min.max
.Op Fl S\*(Bas Ar sepstring
.Op Fl T\*(Bat Ar c
.Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
copies the named files side by side onto the standard output.
The
.Em n Ns -th
input lines from the input
.Ar files
are considered fragments of the single long
.Em n Ns -th
output line into which they are assembled.
The name
.Dq \&-
means the standard input, and may be repeated.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "-s sepstring"
.It Fl F\*(Baf Ar min.max
Print line fragments according to the format string
.Ar min.max ,
where
.Ar min
is the minimum field width and
.Ar max
the maximum field width.
If
.Ar min
begins with a zero, zeros will be prepended to make up the field width
instead of blanks, and if it begins with a
.Sq \&- ,
the fragment will be left-adjusted
within the field.
.Pp
If
.Fl f
is used, it affects only the file after it;
if
.Fl F
is used, it affects all subsequent files
until it appears again uncapitalized.
.It Fl P\*(Bap Ar min.max
Like
.Fl f ,
but pad this file's field when end-of-file is reached
and other files are still active.
.Pp
If
.Fl p
is used, it affects only the file after it;
if
.Fl P
is used, it affects all subsequent files
until it appears again uncapitalized.
.It Fl S\*(Bas Ar sepstring
Print
.Ar sepstring
before printing line fragments from the next file.
This option may appear after the last file.
.Pp
If
.Fl s
is used, it affects only the file after it;
if
.Fl S
is used, it affects all subsequent files
until it appears again uncapitalized.
.It Fl T\*(Bat Ar c
The input line terminator is
.Ar c
instead of a newline.
The newline normally appended to each output line is omitted.
.Pp
If
.Fl t
is used, it affects only the file after it;
if
.Fl T
is used, it affects all subsequent files
until it appears again uncapitalized.
.El
.Pp
To print files simultaneously for easy viewing use
.Xr pr 1 .
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width LC_CTYPE
.It Ev LC_CTYPE
The character encoding
.Xr locale 1 .
It determines the display widths of characters used by the
.Fl f
and
.Fl p
options.
If unset or set to
.Qq C ,
.Qq POSIX ,
or an unsupported value, each byte is regarded as a character
of display width 1.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Join four files together along each line:
.Pp
.Dl $ lam file1 file2 file3 file4
.Pp
Merge the lines from four different files:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ lam file1 \-S "\e
" file2 file3 file4
.Ed
.Pp
Join every two lines of a file:
.Pp
.Dl $ lam \- \- \*(Lt file
.Pp
A form letter with substitutions keyed by
.Sq \&@
can be done with:
.Pp
.Dl $ lam \-t @ letter changes
