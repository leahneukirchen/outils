.Sh NAME
.Nm vis
.Nd display non-printable characters in a visual format
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm vis
.Op Fl abcflnostw
.Op Fl F Ar foldwidth
.Op Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a filter for converting non-printable characters
into a visual representation.
It differs from
.Ic cat -v
in that
the form can be unique and invertible.
By default, all non-printing
characters except space, tab, and newline are encoded,
as are any meta-characters
.Pq eighth bit set .
A detailed description of the
various visual formats is given in
.Xr vis 3 .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Encode all characters, whether originally visible or not.
.It Fl b
Turns off prepending of backslash before up-arrow control sequences
and meta-characters, and disables the doubling of backslashes.
This produces output which is neither invertible nor precise, but does
represent a minimum of change to the input.
It is similar to
.Ic cat -v .
.It Fl c
Request a format which displays a small subset of the
non-printable characters using C-style backslash sequences.
.It Fl F Ar foldwidth
Causes
.Nm
to fold output lines to
.Ar foldwidth
columns, like
.Xr fold 1 ,
except
that a hidden newline sequence is used, (which is removed
when inverting the file back to its original form with
.Xr unvis 1 ) .
If the last character in the encoded file does not end in a newline,
a hidden newline sequence is appended to the output.
This makes
the output usable with various editors and other utilities which
typically don't work with partial lines.
.It Fl f
Like
.Fl F ,
except output is always folded to 80 columns.
.It Fl l
Mark newlines with the visible sequence
.Ql \e$ ,
followed by the newline.
.It Fl n
Turns off any encoding, except for the fact that backslashes are
still doubled and hidden newline sequences inserted if
.Fl f
or
.Fl F
is selected.
When combined with the
.Fl f
flag,
.Nm
becomes like
an invertible version of the
.Xr fold 1
utility.
That is, the output
can be unfolded by running the output through
.Xr unvis 1 .
.It Fl o
Request a format which displays non-printable characters as
an octal number, \eddd.
.It Fl s
Only characters considered unsafe to send to a terminal are encoded.
This flag allows backspace, bell, and carriage return in addition
to the default space, tab, and newline.
Meta-characters that are considered graphic characters by
.Xr isgraph 3
are not encoded.
.It Fl t
Tabs are also encoded.
.It Fl w
White space (space-tab-newline) is also encoded.
